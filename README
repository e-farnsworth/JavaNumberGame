# Overview

This is an quick and simply program to serve as an intorduction to the Java programing language. 

The program itself is a number guesser where users input a number and the program tells them if they guessed to high, to low, or guessed the number. The user is allowed a maximum of 20 attempts to guess the correct number before they are forced to give up. The program has two dificulty levels: Easy and Hard. For the Easy level, the number is between 0 and 100. For the hard level, the number is between 0 and 1000.
